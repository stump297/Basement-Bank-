## Overview

The Basement Coin Savings App is designed to help users visualize how much money they've saved across different rooms in their basement. The app calculates how many coins are needed to fill each room based on the room's volume, and users can adjust their savings dynamically. The updated savings are reflected in a real-time bar chart, giving users a clear visual representation of their progress.

## Features

- **User Information**: Displays the username and email of the logged-in user.
- **Room Savings**: Shows the volume of each room and how much money (in the form of coins) is required to fill the room.
- **Coin Manipulation**: Users can add or subtract coins to/from the savings in each room, with the corresponding changes shown in both text and the bar chart.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Responsive bar charts using `Recharts` to display the number of coins needed to fill each room vs. the number of coins saved.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Apollo Client**: A GraphQL client for managing data fetching and caching.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows the app to retrieve room and user data.
- **Recharts**: A charting library for building responsive bar charts.
- **CSS**: For styling the UI components.
